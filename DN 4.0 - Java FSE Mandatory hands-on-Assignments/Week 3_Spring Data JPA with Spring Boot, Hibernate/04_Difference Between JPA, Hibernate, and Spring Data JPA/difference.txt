Java Persistence API (JPA):
JPA is a specification (JSR 338) that defines a standard for ORM in Java.

It provides a standard API for:

Mapping Java objects to database tables.

Managing lifecycle and relationships.

It contains only interfaces and annotations; no implementation.

Needs an implementation like Hibernate, EclipseLink, etc.

Hibernate:
Hibernate is an ORM (Object Relational Mapping) tool.

It is the most popular implementation of JPA.

It offers additional features over the JPA spec like:

HQL (Hibernate Query Language)

First and second-level caching

Requires manual configuration of sessions, transactions, etc.

Spring Data JPA:
It is not a JPA implementation.

It is an abstraction layer over JPA implementations like Hibernate.

Reduces boilerplate code and provides:

Ready-made JpaRepository interface.

Auto-generated queries based on method names.

Automatic transaction management.

Highly integrated with Spring Boot.
